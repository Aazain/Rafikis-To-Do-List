# To Do List
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Node.JS, MongoDB, and Mongoose
A frontend Framework, Svelte was also used

This To Do List allows you to save multiple items to a list which can be crossed off when completed or edited if needed.

To successfully run this code, you need to make sure that you have NodeJS installed on you computer and, that the server is running using the terminal command `node server.js` If anything goes wrong, make sure that the following packages are installed properly using the `npm install` command. There are __3 *different* package files__, one for each frontend and one for the backend so make sure to install both:

-Body-Parser
-Express
-Mongoose
-Dotenv
-Svelte
-Cors
-jsonwebtoken
-Svelte
-bcrypt

To actually run the frontend client, cd into the mySvelteFrontend or svelteRouting folder and type in `npm run start:dev` in the terminal and it should start on localhost port 5000.

There are 2 different types of apps. The /mySvelte-Frontend is a Client Side Rendered app while the /svelteRouting(outdated) is a Server Side Rendered app (using sapper).

It is recommended to install nodemon for the backend if you decide to edit the files. Nodemon restarts the server everytime you apply a save to the JS file so that you dont need to type in node server.js everytime you make a change to the file.
