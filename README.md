# To Do List
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Node.JS, MongoDB, and Mongoose
A frontend Framework, Svelte was also used

This To Do List allows you to save multiple items to a list which can be crossed off when completed or edited if needed.

To successfully run this code, you need to make sure that you have NodeJS installed on you computer and, that the server is running using the terminal command `node server.js` If anything goes wrong, make sure that the following packages are installed properly using the `npm install` command. There are __2 *different* package files__, one for frontend and one for the backend so make sure to install both:

-Body-Parser
-EJS
-Express
-Mongoose
-Dotenv
-Svelte
-Cors

It is recommended to install nodemon if you decide to edit the files. Nodemon restarts the server everytime you apply a save to the JS file so that you dont need to type in node server.js everytime you make a change to the file.
