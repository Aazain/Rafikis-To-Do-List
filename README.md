# To Do List
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Typescript/JavaScript, React, Node.JS, MongoDB, and Mongoose
A frontend Framework, Svelte was also used

This To Do List allows you to save multiple items to a list which can be crossed off when completed or edited if needed.

To successfully run this code, you need to make sure that you have NodeJS installed on your computer. If anything goes wrong, make sure that the following packages are installed properly using the `npm install` command.

The packages used were:
```
-Body-Parser
-Express
-Mongoose
-Cors
-jsonwebtoken
-bcrypt
-react-dom
-react-router-dom
-sweetalert
-typescript
-react
```
Nodemon is recommended when working on the files, it re-runs the files anytime you make an edit.

To run the React locally, cd into `frontend\rafikis-to-do-list` and then use the `npm start` command.

To work on the backend files, cd into `backend` and use the `tsc` command. (make sure `watch: true` is in the tsconfig.json file so that is automatically runs tsc between changes)

To run the server, cd into `backend\dist` and run `nodemon server.js`.
